# Shot By Shot
In the game of basketball two teams compete head to head to determine which team can successfully score more points than the other. The most important aspect of the game is a player's ability to score, which involves successfully shooting a basketball into a net. In that sense, it would be extremely informative to a player, team, and overall basketball organization if they were able to predict the outcome of a certain shot selection. The goal of this project is to utilize machine learning models to see how well we can predict the outcome of a basketball shot. This involves using various classification models, conducting hyperparameter tuning, and identifying various important features to optimize our modelâ€™s predictive accuracy in identifying whether a basketball shot is a make or a miss.  

## Models
After using Logestic Regresion, Decision Trees, and an XGBoost model, I found that the XGBoost model had the best performance with an accuracy of 65.28%. Below is a shot chart with the left being a random sample of 100 of Stephen Curry's shots in the 2021 season. The visualization for Stephen Curry's actual shooting is named 'Actual Shots' while the visualization of the XGBoosted model is called 'XGBoost Predictions'.
